# Hi, I'm Javier Quintero 👋
### Senior Full-Stack Developer | Architectural Specialist

> **Note on GitHub Activity:** For the past 10 years, I have operated as a successful independent consultant and freelance developer. During this lucrative period, I managed my own versioning systems and private infrastructure tailored for high-velocity delivery. I am now transitioning to Git and open-source workflows to collaborate with larger engineering teams and contribute to the broader developer community.

## 📈 Independent Mindset
* **Business Focused:** I don't just write code; I build solutions that drive revenue. Freelancing taught me to prioritize the features that matter most to the end-user.
* **Architectural Independence:** My experience managing "various copies and versioning" manually has given me a deep, fundamental understanding of code state and file integrity that goes beyond just running Git commands.
* **Adaptability:** Successfully navigated the pre-AI freelance market by staying ahead of tech trends and delivering high-value, custom-built software.
